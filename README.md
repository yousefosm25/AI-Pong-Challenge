# AI Pong Challenge 🧠🏓

A classic Pong game where the paddles are controlled by AI agents trained using the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm. This project demonstrates how artificial neural networks can evolve over generations to master a simple game like Pong — no hardcoded logic, just evolution.
